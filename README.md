**Trip Booking Form
Overview**
The Trip Booking Form is a simple PHP-based application that collects user data related to a trip they want to go on. The form stores this data in a MySQL database using XAMPP, making it easy to manage trip bookings.

**Features**
User Input Form: Collects details such as trip destination, preferred dates, and personal information from users.
Data Storage: The form stores submitted data in a MySQL database for future retrieval and management.
PHP and MySQL Integration: Uses PHP to handle form submissions and insert the data into a MySQL database.
XAMPP Environment: Designed to run in a local XAMPP server environment.
